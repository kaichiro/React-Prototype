Clone this project according to this command just below...

NOTE: I have modified the name of the specific project (`react-ts`), but you can change it to any other valid name.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaichiro/React-Prototype.git react-ts
cd react-ts
```

Installing the necessary packages to run the project (`package.json`)

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

If you are using Linux or Mac OS, add `SUDO` before the commands, if necessary.
